MMC Doom (Mint Chocolate Chip Doom) Is a attempt to make a 100% accurate Doom source port for windows. It's like Chocolate Doom but without the extra features or bug fixes meaning even the worst and the best bugs won't be patched.
Chocolate Doom has chocolate at the beggining due to the original being "Vannila Doom." Obviously having a play with words and referencing Ice Cream flavors. So for the name I chose Mint Chocolate Chip Doom Due to me liking the flavor.
Now Since This Project will be Aiming at making it as accurate as possible, that means that you can't do things that weren't In the original. Such as Music packs, Pwads, Dehacked and other modding or customization things.
But I plan on making a sort of mod manager like thing as a separate thing to download that modifies the game like any other mod manager. But won't be integrated into the source port, Meaning it will probably have it's own github page.
NOTICE: So far this is just a simple little fork with no progress whatsoever, the reason? I Can't understand C or any programming language whatsoever but I'm willing to learn it. That's the reason why there is no links anywhere because I don't want to get attention and make people think I'm gonna be like that one dumb guy that promised a sonic unleashed decomp or something. But hey if you came across this, good for you I guess.
